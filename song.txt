Break down, only alone I will cry on out
You'll never see what's hiding out
Hiding out deep down
Yeah, yeah

I know, I've heard that to let your feelings go
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I'm too afraid now
Yeah, yeah

I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am
